Pre-requisites for the current iteration of the web testing framework, which relies on Selenium, are to have Firefox and the Java Run Time installed on the server.
Projects that invoke the WebTestingFramework must reference the Selenium Core DLL and the nUnit core dll. This is so the tests generated by Selenium compile correctly.

There is a problem with testing locally for sites that use SSL.
Using the -trustAllSSLCertificates flag is supposed to work with Firefox, but it doesn't.
Using the -firefoxProfileTemplate flag to point to a folder with cert_override.txt and cert8.db files that have an exception specified for the Main certificate does work, but it's a pain.

To run tests locally, you must copy cert_override.txt and cert8.db from a Firefox profile that has an exception for the Main certificate into c:\Red Stapler\Selenium Support\Firefox.
