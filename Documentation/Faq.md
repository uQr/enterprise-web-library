# FAQ

*	*Why restrict the name of EWL providers? They already have to implement an interface, shouldn't that be the only handle we need to find the implementation in the system? Why do they have to name it a certain way too?*

	We force each provider to use a specific name to save you the effort of having to think of what to name it.
